For hardware You will need 100mil (2.54mm) male and female PCB edge connectors
Male: Amphenol 	10129378-920003BLF (get 40 pin edge connector and cut apart what you need)
Female: Adafruit 36-PIN 0.1 FEMALE HEADER- 5PK (digikey 1528-2537-ND)

Also 4/40 phillips screws (I used 3/4" Pan Phillips but most anything about this size will work) with nuts and washers to secure daughterboards to this PCB)
