Schematics, eagle files etc for AD9833 VCO

I have an ongoing project--building a volt octave VCO using the AD9833 function generator IC.  This repo has current zips of Eagle files, BOMs, gerbers, and PDFs of boards and schematics.

What I post here (1-30-23) works on my bench but could stand some improvement in terms of frequency stability and generally improving the triangle to ramp conversion. The rest of it seems to work. I will update the zips here as I continue to improve this design...

Blog post (which links other posts about this project) is here.

Embedded C for this project can be found in this repo: AD9833-VCO
